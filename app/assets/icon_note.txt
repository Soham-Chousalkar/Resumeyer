To complete the packaging process, you'll need to add an icon file named "icon.ico" in this directory.

You can create an .ico file from any image using online converters or tools like:
1. https://convertio.co/png-ico/
2. https://icoconvert.com/
3. Or use professional tools like Photoshop or GIMP

The recommended size for the icon is 256x256 pixels.

Once you have your icon.ico file, place it in this directory (app/assets/) and run the packaging command:

npm run make-exe
